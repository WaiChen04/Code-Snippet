These are some of the codes I used to simulate the Ising model on a quantum computer using Qiskit. The code outlines the function to import and implament quantum gates onto a quantum circuit. It also provides a way to simulate the circuit, store the results in an array, and graph them using Matplotlib.
The quantum circuit may look something like this:

This was the resulting graph for the first observable:
